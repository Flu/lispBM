  * MACLISP
  * InterLisp

## Sources for further information about lisp

* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (book: get an old edition).
* YouTube lectures by Hal Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman (These are awesome).

## What I think of when hearing LISP

* Lots of parenthesis.
* Dynamically typed.
* Functional.
  * Higher order functions.
  * Lambdas, Closures. 
* Homoiconicity
* Garbage collection. Automatic memory management.
* FUN!
